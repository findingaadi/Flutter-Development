# Introduction

## 23/01/2024

Starting out to learn flutter. Flutter is a Google product and seems like its gaining major marketshare in the last couple years as some companies are switching from native app development to crossplatform as it is easier and cheaper to main one code-base compared to multiple.

 Main reason being its cross platform and i want to start to develop actual products/applications which i can deploy. The joy of creating something on the fly is what i am chasing. 

For the backend, i will be starting with Firebase, and later want to move to learn Django or node.js

To start with, i have created developer accounts on Google and Apple inorder to deploy applications on Android and ios.
